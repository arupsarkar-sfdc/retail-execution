## 🎯 **Business Capabilities Analysis**

### **Current B2C Capabilities (From Customer Context)**

Based on the provided context, the following B2C capabilities and systems are identified:

#### **1. Customer Lifecycle Management**
- **Digital Consumer Experience (DCX):** The current architecture, an evolution of DCE2, with a micro-services approach and flexibility for markets. Covers multiple product categories (IQOS, VEEV, ZYN).
- **Digital Consumer Engagement (DCE):** Older Salesforce-supported architecture (stopped ~6 years ago).
- **Persona vs. Identity Management:**
    - **Persona:** One physical individual, made of all identities (logins). Created for marketing & analytics. No confirmation for logical merge. Block at Persona level blocks all identities. Marketing communication based on Persona.
    - **Identity:** One login account. Actions registered at identity level. Unknown profiles (cookie-based) captured. Opt-in managed at identity level, but call center can opt-out at Persona level. AV, T&C, consents not shared between identities.
- **Segmentation:** Segment Activation to Marketing Cloud, Service Cloud, Hybris, Adobe Target.
- **Next Best Action (NBA):** Supporting NBA in Salesforce Service Cloud (SvC).

#### **2. Commerce & Fulfillment**
- **Referral Marketing:** Implemented in Hybris.
- **Personalization:** With Adobe Target.

#### **3. Workforce Management**
- **Salesforce Service Cloud (SvC):** Used for customer service, supporting NBA.

#### **4. Data Management & Processing**
- **DISP (Product Availability / Data collection and processing system):** Handles data collection and processing from older systems (DCS, DC1) and DCX, applying data quality rules and feeding into other systems like Treasure Data and Stitching (acts as an ETL/ELT layer, using AWS Glue, S3).
- **Treasure Data (TD) Layers:**
    - **DB_l0_organic:** Raw data from DCE2.0, append-only via TD Write API.
    - **Db_stg_organic:** Consolidates data transformation (validation, parsing, reference data mapping), append-only, audit layer.
    - **Db_l1_organic:** Reads from `db_stg_organic`, loads to identity data model, truncate/reload mode, handles rejected/incomplete records.
    - **Db_l2_organic:** Reads from `db_l1_organic`, loads to identity data model, truncate/reload mode.
    - **Db_l3_merge:** L3 layer exposed to Audience Builder and outbound apps, merges `l2_organic` and `l2_legacy` for global consumer view.
- **Audit & Housekeeping:**
    - **Db_audit:** Holds rejected records (persona/entity identifier, rejection reason).
    - **Db_housekeeping_organic:** Holds info on records identified/deleted for housekeeping.
- **Monitoring & Technical:**
    - **Db_monitoring:** Logs workflow success/failure for TD workflows.
    - **Db_stg_technical:** Regroups technical info (delta load log, scheduling, metadata mapping).
    - **Db_stg_temp:** Holds temporary tables.
- **Data Transformation:** Shared with DISP.
- **Data Activation:** All objects into Snowflake, DISP, and Marketing Cloud.
- **Delta Mechanism:** Logic (A, B, C, D) to identify changed/created data/entities, impacted identities, and personas between CDP refreshes for synchronization with external systems (ADL, SFMC, Adobe Target, DMP). For derived attributes/segments, comparison of new vs. previous full tables.
- **Snowflake:** Took over analytics/data science capabilities from TD.
- **AWS (DISP):** Took more data harmonization/ETL capabilities.

#### **5. Data Quality & Governance**
- **Duplicate & Fraud Detection:** Automated mechanism to recognize duplicates and potential fraudulent activities using SimHash algorithm via Python script.
- **Matching Unknown with Known Identities:** Matching Gigya ID of known identity with Gigya ID in consolidated section of unknown identity (cookie-based).

### **Future State B2C Capabilities with Data Cloud & Agentforce**

The future state architecture will enhance these capabilities by providing:

-   **Unified Customer Profile:** A true 360-degree view of the B2C customer (Persona) by consolidating all identity data (logins, cookies, device IDs) from DCX, SFMC, Hybris, and other sources into Data Cloud's canonical data model and identity resolution.
-   **Real-time Personalization:** Leveraging Data Cloud's streaming capabilities and Agentforce's predictive intelligence to deliver hyper-personalized experiences across all digital channels (DCX, Adobe Target, SFMC) in real-time.
-   **Intelligent Next Best Action (NBA):** Agentforce will power more sophisticated and context-aware NBA recommendations within Service Cloud and other customer-facing applications, moving beyond rule-based systems.
-   **Streamlined Data Management:** Data Cloud will centralize data ingestion, transformation, and harmonization, simplifying the current complex Treasure Data layers (L0-L3) and AWS Glue/S3 ETL processes, providing a single source of truth.
-   **Proactive Customer Service:** Agentforce can enable proactive outreach and intelligent routing in Service Cloud based on real-time customer behavior and predicted needs.
-   **Advanced Segmentation & Activation:** Data Cloud's robust segmentation engine will allow for more dynamic and granular audience creation, with seamless activation to Marketing Cloud, Adobe Target, and other platforms.
-   **Enhanced Fraud & Duplicate Detection:** Data Cloud's identity resolution capabilities, combined with Agentforce's analytical power, can provide a more robust and automated system for identifying duplicates and potential fraudulent activities, potentially integrating or replacing SimHash scripts.
-   **Operational Efficiency:** Automation of data pipelines and AI-driven insights will reduce manual effort and improve the speed of decision-making.

1.  **Unified Customer Profile (Persona vs. Identity Resolution):**
    *   **Challenge:** The current system distinguishes between "Persona" (physical individual) and "Identity" (login account/cookie), with complex rules for merging and managing preferences. Data is fragmented across DCX, SFMC, Hybris, and legacy systems.
    *   **Solution:** Data Cloud's robust Identity Resolution capabilities are purpose-built to unify disparate customer data points. It can ingest data from all B2C sources (DCX, SFMC, SvC, Hybris, Web/Mobile, Legacy) and stitch together a comprehensive "Persona" view, linking all associated "Identities" (logins, cookie IDs, device IDs). This provides a true 360-degree view, essential for consistent marketing and service.
    *   **Benefit:** Eliminates data silos, ensures a single source of truth for each customer, and enables consistent experiences regardless of the touchpoint or identity used. This directly supports the "Persona view is made of all the identities (logins) that one individual has" concept.

2.  **Real-time Personalization & Engagement:**
    *   **Challenge:** Personalization is done with Adobe Target, but real-time, cross-channel consistency is difficult with fragmented data and batch-oriented delta processing.
    *   **Solution:** Data Cloud's streaming ingestion (CDC) and real-time Calculated Insights allow for immediate processing of customer behavior. This real-time profile can then power personalization engines (like Adobe Target) and marketing campaigns (SFMC) with the most up-to-date context.
    *   **Benefit:** Delivers hyper-personalized experiences across DCX, email, mobile, and commerce platforms, increasing engagement, conversion rates, and customer loyalty.

3.  **Streamlined Data Management & Processing:**
    *   **Challenge:** The current Treasure Data architecture involves multiple layers (L0-L3, staging, audit, housekeeping, monitoring, technical, temp) and complex delta logic (A, B, C, D) for synchronization. AWS and Snowflake have taken over some ETL/analytics, indicating a distributed and potentially complex data pipeline.
    *   **Solution:** Data Cloud acts as a centralized Customer Data Platform (CDP), consolidating ingestion, transformation, and modeling. It can ingest raw data (similar to TD L0), apply data quality and transformation rules (similar to TD Staging), and build a canonical customer profile (similar to TD L1/L2/L3 merge). Its native CDC and delta processing capabilities simplify the complex manual delta logic, ensuring efficient synchronization with downstream systems.
    *   **Benefit:** Reduces operational overhead, improves data quality, accelerates time-to-insight, and provides a more agile foundation for data-driven initiatives, freeing up resources from managing complex ETL/ELT pipelines.

4.  **Advanced Segmentation & Activation:**
    *   **Challenge:** Segmentation is activated to various platforms (Marketing Cloud, Service Cloud, Hybris, Adobe Target), but the process for derived attributes and segments requires comparing full tables between refreshes.
    *   **Solution:** Data Cloud's segmentation engine allows for dynamic, attribute-rich segments based on real-time and historical data. It can manage derived attributes and segments efficiently, and its activation capabilities ensure these segments are pushed seamlessly and consistently to all connected B2C channels.
    *   **Benefit:** Enables more precise targeting for marketing campaigns, personalized offers, and tailored service interactions, leading to higher ROI and improved customer satisfaction.

### **Agentforce for B2C**

1.  **Intelligent Next Best Action (NBA):**
    *   **Challenge:** NBA is supported in Service Cloud, likely based on predefined rules or simpler models.
    *   **Solution:** Agentforce's Predictive AI capabilities can leverage the rich, unified data in Data Cloud to generate highly accurate and context-aware NBA recommendations. This goes beyond simple rules to incorporate customer history, real-time behavior, propensity scores, and external factors.
    *   **Benefit:** Empowers service agents with intelligent guidance, improves cross-sell/up-sell opportunities, and enhances the overall customer journey by offering relevant actions at the right time.

2.  **Proactive & Personalized Customer Service:**
    *   **Challenge:** Service interactions are often reactive.
    *   **Solution:** Agentforce, integrated with Service Cloud and Data Cloud, can identify customers at risk or those likely to need assistance, enabling proactive outreach. Foundational AI can power intelligent chatbots or assist agents with generative responses, improving resolution times and customer satisfaction.
    *   **Benefit:** Transforms customer service from reactive to proactive, reduces churn, and creates a more efficient and satisfying support experience.

3.  **Enhanced Fraud & Duplicate Detection:**
    *   **Challenge:** Automated duplicate and potential fraudulent activity detection uses SimHash via Python script, and matching unknown identities with known ones is a specific use case.
    *   **Solution:** Agentforce's AI capabilities, combined with Data Cloud's comprehensive customer profiles, can develop more sophisticated models for anomaly detection and fraud prevention. This can augment or replace existing SimHash scripts with more advanced machine learning techniques, identifying patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior or complex duplicate scenarios.
    *   **Benefit:** Strengthens security, reduces financial losses due to fraud, and maintains data integrity by accurately identifying and managing duplicate customer records.

4.  **Automated Content & Communication:**
    *   **Challenge:** Managing personalized content across multiple channels (DCX, SFMC, Adobe Target) requires significant manual effort and coordination.
    *   **Solution:** Agentforce can generate personalized content, optimize messaging, and orchestrate multi-channel campaigns based on real-time customer insights from Data Cloud.
    *   **Benefit:** Reduces manual content creation effort, ensures consistent messaging across channels, and improves campaign effectiveness through AI-driven optimization.

### **Strategic Business Value**

1.  **Operational Efficiency:**
    *   **Reduced Complexity:** Data Cloud simplifies the current multi-layer TD architecture, reducing maintenance overhead and improving reliability.
    *   **Automated Processes:** Agentforce automates routine tasks, freeing up human resources for strategic activities.
    *   **Faster Time-to-Market:** Streamlined data processing and AI-driven insights accelerate campaign launches and feature rollouts.
